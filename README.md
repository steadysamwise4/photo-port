## Description <a name="description"></a>
<sub>_***Built With:***_</sub> <sub>JavaScript,CSS,ES6,Node,React,Jest</sub> </br>
This project was all about introducing myself to the basics of React.js. It is a front end only application. I used the create-react-app program to begin the project, then introduced my own components and uploaded photo's. It conditionally renders different photo's and categories of photo's using modal's and remains a single page application. The contact form is set up, but not currently connected to any back end to actually recieve the contact information. This was an excellent learning project that I can use as a reference going forward with exploring more react functionality.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
Within Node, use the command 'npx create-react-app' to set up a skeleton of a basic react project for yourself. To see this app deployed click the link below.
